### Description - how our app works

Baby, Boat & Brands is a web application created for entertainment and for business.
It has a basic function: provide for the user an easy way to find suggestions for babies, boats and brands names.
Here is how it works:
1. The firts function is to provide the user a new "metric" for distance betweem 2 points, not using miles ou kilometers, but using music!
So, the user can see how many musics is the distance of the 2 points.

2. The second function is to create a playlist.
The user will be able to set 2 locations (like, cities) and some artist, and the app wil show a sort of albums.
The user can select all the tracks that he wants to putt in the playlist.
Then the app will can calculates the drive time, and compares it to the duration a playlist takes to play.

This is a nice application for a good trip!
