What is it?

We have developed an app that gives the user the uniqueness that they want, based on inputs they submit.

These can be names, nouns, places, and things.

Targeted at newborn parents, with the bonus of utilizing it for a plethora of concepts, such as; brands, businesses, pets, boats, pets, and an infinite list of material objects.

There are 15,000 births every hour, documented in the world. Which is a massive growth in population, throughout the world. A life brought into this world, is a precious blessing. Deciding on a name, is meaningful, and we provide that value through our application. We want ed to provide a way to make is easier, yet having a tremendous amount of value.

Our app is a sophisticated and easy to use, user input unique name generator. Easy enough for a 4 year old to use.
